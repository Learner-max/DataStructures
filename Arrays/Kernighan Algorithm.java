		        Count set bits in a integer.

                    Binary representation of 6 is 110 and has 2 set bits

                    Output : 3
                    Binary representation of 13 is 1101 and has 3 set bits
		        
		        Method#1 : Naive approach
		        Check Bit in the number and increment the counter if it is set.
		        TC:theta(log n)
		
		        Method#2 : Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm
		        Idea is to subtract Rsbm from the number , it will flip or delete/remove
		        or unset the bit (from 1 to 0)
		        We will repeat this step until number becomes 0. And while doing this 
		        every time we increment the counter.
		        TC: O(logn)
		            Where n means number of set bits in the given number
		            ***** the number of times it loops is equal to the 
		            number of set bits in a given integer*******
